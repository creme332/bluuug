# bluuug ðŸ¦š

A minimalist personal blogging website with a [headless CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/tp/headless-cms-explained)

The project is split into 2 sub-projects:
1. `cms-api` contains the backend code for creating the API of the headless CMS.
2. `cms-gui` contains the frontend code for the content management system. It is accessible only to the administrator.

> [!NOTE]  
> bluuug was a project developed for The Odin Project [Blog API assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-blog-api). It is no longer being actively developed due to time constraints. Only the `cms-api` section is somewhat complete.
